This program reads an ARXML file containing a list of containers, each with a unique ID, and reorders the containers alphabetically by their name sub-container â€œ"SHORT-NAME" then writes the reordered container to a new ARXML file.  
  
To test this project run the batch file which tests 3 cases:
1. A non valid file (not in arxml format)
2. A empty arxml file
3. A normal sample file and its execution

The Output of the batch file sould fail for the first 2 cases and throws an exception in the terminal
The third case should run normally and create a new file called "sampleTest1_mod.arxml"
